# Machine Learning Operations - Model Pipeline for Stock Price Prediction

## Problem Statement
We aim to predict stock prices using two years of data from the Online Retail Dataset, which includes sales of stocks in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. While it is recognized that using historical data to predict stock prices may not be effective in real-world scenarios, this dataset serves the purpose of building the infrastructure for model training and deployment in this project.

### Dataset
The [Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/online-retail-dataset) contains information about sales transactions, including stock codes, quantities sold, invoice dates, and countries.

## Objective
Our goal is to leverage this dataset to develop a machine learning pipeline that can predict future stock prices based on historical data.
